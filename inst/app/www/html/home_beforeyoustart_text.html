<p>As you probably know, milQuant is a one-person-project. I would be immensely grateful for any feedback you can give me. That may be bugs or problems you encounter while using this app, or even feature requests. You can contact me via the <a href="https://github.com/lsteinmann/milQuant">Issues / Contact</a> link on the left or at <a href="mailto:lisa.steinmann@rub.de">lisa.steinmann@rub.de</a></p>
<p>Please note that this app tries to be as accurate as possible, but it is no substitute for transparent and reproducible analysis and instead aims to give you a quick overview of your data. For publications, I highly recommend trying to recreate the graphs with your own analysis either using the csv-exports from Field Desktop or by doing it directly in <i class="fa-brands fa-r-project"></i>. With the latter, you can use <a href="https://github.com/lsteinmann/idaifieldR">idaifieldR</a> to import your data.</p>
